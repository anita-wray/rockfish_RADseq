# Anita Wray's Rockfish RADseq Project - September 2020 - December 2022
Scripts from masters project on rockfish population structure in Puget Sound, WA


Objective of Project(s):
1. Investigate the effect of interspecific hybridization and introgression in Puget Sound on genetic population structure in Brown, Copper, and Quillback rockfishes
2. Provide a comprehensive survey of population structure of all common rockfishes in Puget Sound and the Washington coast, with aim to inform fisheries management and provide data for potential petitions for ESA listing of some species
